# Text Classification Naive Bayes Vs Support Vector Machine

Goal is to have each model predict whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0)
From there an analysis will be given

Goals for future: 
- Fully implement the SVM customly
- Make improvements on Naive Bayes Classifier
- Have the emails be moved into the 'Spam' folder on the email server
